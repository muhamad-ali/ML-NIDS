  Web Browsing
  Emails
  Microsoft, Google Services
  HTTP HTTPS SSH FTP sessions
  Data downloads

Cicflowmeter-4 is then used to extract flows from this captures traffic and csv files are present in the following .rar files

1-Dataset-1.rar
	Contains all csvs of packet captures that are generated by Cicflowmeter-4. They include 
	more number of sql attacks

2-Dataset-2.rar
	Contains all csvs of packet captures that are generated by Cicflowmeter-4. They include 
	less number of sql attacks
Dataset files are compressed to limitation of filesize of github
